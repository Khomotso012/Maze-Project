Maze project

The Maze is a 3D Maze game that uses ray casting to render a 2D map into a 3D navigable world!

Team Members:
No team members, Completing the project individually(Khomotso Mohlahlana).

Technologies:
The Maze was written was written in C ussing SDL2 library. Deveploment was performed using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4.

SDL2 Will be used. Simple DirectMedia Layer(SDL) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games.

Challenge statement:
The goal of this project is to create a game in 3D using raycasting !


 Risks:
Be careful with tutorials/help online: We are using SDL2, and not SDL-1.2 !
Infrastructure:
Since I am doing the project Individually I will be the one submitting everything onto to github. I will also create separate folders in my repository for headers, images and the source code.

Existing Solutions:
There are many similar games in 3D using raycasting :
Rise of the Triad: Dark War
Knuckles Cakewalk 3D

Architecture:






API:
My initial plan is to create an API using Python.

Challenges:
Struggled a little bit with installing SDL 2:
